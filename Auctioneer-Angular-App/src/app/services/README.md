  // TODO Ask?
  // get mock data for offers and display that.
  // services and mock data should be separate?
  // Let's implement this for now, but keep an eye on it just in case we need to implement this another way.
  // By creating another file where we keep our mock data, and return that instead.
  // I think this needs to be defined in the overview3 component. and than called in the constructor.
  ```typescript
  getOffers(): Offer[] {
    return this.offers;
  }
  ```
